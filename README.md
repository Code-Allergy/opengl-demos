This is a simple project to run OpenGL demos as I progress through [OpenGL Tutorial](https://www.opengl-tutorial.org/) as part of CMPT485. 
Most of these demos will be simple alterations to the given code in this [repo](https://github.com/opengl-tutorials/ogl).


# Usage
If you have Nix package manager installed, you can type nix-shell to enter the shell environment, downloading all required dependencies.
Otherwise, install the dependencies manually through your system's package manager, and run `source ./setup.sh` to use the provided convenience
functions.
